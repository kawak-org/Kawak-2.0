KawaK is a free meritocratic tool where good feedback on peers‚Äô articles  is rewarded by matching writers with others who provide the same quality of feedback. KawaK hopes to y that values the development of thought, writing and expression by providing a tool that is accessible to anyone.
We aim to leverage NFTs so that writers have proof of ownership of their work, should plagiarism issues arise. Tokenization will also play a key role and thanks to the Zora protocol we are able to use ERC standards and design an  ERC‚Äë20 social token for KawaK posts alongside the zora ecosystem.

## ZoraCoin Integration üöÄ

KawaK integrates with the [Zora Protocol](https://zora.co/) to allow users to mint custom ERC-20 coins for their essays. This enables essay creators to launch their own tokens, with metadata and images stored on IPFS via Pinata.

**Integration Workflow:**
- Users configure and mint a coin for their essay using a dedicated form.
- Metadata and images are uploaded to IPFS.
- The coin is deployed to the Zora blockchain and associated with the essay.
- All created coins are displayed in the Marketplace.

**Main Integration Points:**
- `kawak/src/kawak_assets/services/ZoraCoinService.ts` ‚Äì Core service for Zora coin creation and metadata handling.
- `kawak/src/kawak_assets/components/essay/EssayCoinForm.tsx` ‚Äì React form for configuring and minting coins.
- `kawak/src/kawak_assets/pages/CraftEssay.tsx` ‚Äì Page for essay creation and coin minting workflow.
- `kawak/src/kawak_assets/pages/MarketPlace.tsx` ‚Äì Displays all minted coins and their details.

See the top of each file for detailed documentation on how ZoraCoin is integrated and used in the platform.
